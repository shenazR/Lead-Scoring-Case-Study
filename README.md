# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Logistic regression model to assign lead score and target potential leads

## Introduction
This case study involves an analysis on the data from an education company that sells online courses to industry professionals. Here, the goal is to build a model to predict the conversion rate of the leads based on the assigned lead scores.
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google.
Once the interested people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Also, the company gets leads through past referrals. Employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. with the intention of converting the leads. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%, which is low and needs to be improved.
Also, the CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

## Solution
We build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score means that the lead is hot, i.e. most likely to convert and a lower score means that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
